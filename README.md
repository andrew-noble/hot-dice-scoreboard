# ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¥ Hot Dice Scoreboard ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ²

This is a scoreboard that can be used to track a game of hot dice (aka "farkle" or "around the corner"). It shows each player's score, and conducts the game logic by accepting roll entries and
prompting the user to make decisions. I made this as an exercise to practice react. The app is hosted here: https://andrewrn0.github.io/hot-dice-scoreboard/
