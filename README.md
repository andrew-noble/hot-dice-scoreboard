# ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¥ Hot Dice Scoreboard ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ²

This is a scoreboard that can be used to track a game of hot dice (aka "farkle" or "around the corner"). It shows each player's score, and conducts the game logic and math too. Its not too hard
to do this on paper, but this scoreboard makes it more visual who is winning.
