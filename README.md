# ðŸŽ²ðŸ”¥ Hot Dice Scoreboard ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ²

Some friends of mine often play a game we call around the corner. Its a dice game involving taking strategic risks. I decided to make this scoreboard app to help keep track of score and make it easier for eveyone who is playing to see who is winning (normally this would be done with pen and paper and a fair bit of math). Tha game is also known as farkle or hot dice.

It shows each player's score, and conducts the game logic by accepting roll entries and
prompting the user to make decisions. I made this as an exercise to practice react. The app is hosted here: https://andrewrn0.github.io/hot-dice-scoreboard/
